# Wordlist-Collection
This particular collection has been one of my most successfuls-
ALL CREDIT goes to their orignal authors and it has been way to long to remember where I got each of them and I have merged 
some of them as well. Feel free to name them whatever you like as in my naming system is crap lol.


The biggest one is sorted-wordlist.txt this includes most if not all the wordlist that I have the highest success rate with. I tried to sort/clean this one as best as I could.

amerged.txt- all of Seclist dictionaries in one.

Selected Keyspaces.txt- a listing of popular manufacturers default password configurations.

8-sorted is a wordlist of 8 characters 

realuniq.txt-Unique style passwords

Netgearkiller.txt- Used against "NETGEARxx" designated AP. I also uploaded the netgearxx original file-can be used in hybrid mask attack- as well as a standalone dicitonary. I suggest looking up more information about NETGEAR passwords.

MD5dic.txt- Best used against MD5 hashes but has proven it self against other hashes.

10d.txt-the first three digits  number in the U.S-used in hybrid mask attack.

The rest of the wordlist are smaller ones that have proven successful as well.
